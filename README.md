Resource Usage for Calyx designs. 

Currently, I have some bad python scripts (I will improve them). 

I ran these scripts to get some preliminary resource numbers for LeNet, SqueezeNet, and MobileNet (we have only verified correctness of LeNet). The summary folder just extracts the most important information from the results folder.
